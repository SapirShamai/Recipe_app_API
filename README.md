# Recipe API Project

The recipe API is a tool to manage and label your recipes.

In this project I covered:
 - Setting up a project using Docker configuration
 - GitHub Actions
 - Adding endpoints for creating and managing users, tags, ingredients, recipes
 - Adding filtering to the list endpoints
 - Uploading images
 - Deploying the project to an AWS server
 - writing lots of unit tests!

This entire project was developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) in order to improve the code quality and to make it easier tp refactor in the future. 

To use the project, simply install Docker, clone the project and copy the `.env.sample` file to a new `.env` file and configure the data.
